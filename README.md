# smid_sh
My own command line interpreter written c++. Always looking for some help to make it better

The goal is to somewhat mimic the functionality of a standard Unix-like shell. Maybe with some other tools.
The ideal outcome of this project is to make this simple enough to port to homebrew devices, new and old.

So far a few commands work. Still learning how to interface with the machine and the kernel effectively.
Really struggling with directories at this time, so the cd command is inoperative. 

Also there is a commented section with PID numbers for each command. I'd eventually like to mesh that with error checking and debugging
